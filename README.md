# Overview
This interactive map is designed to show any eathquakes occurring across the U.S. in the last seven days. 

# Interactive display
Viewers can hover over each circle to see more detail about the location and severity of the earthquake represented. Based on the location of fault lines in the United States, most of our data is clustered around the west coast. The zoom tool is useful here for searching specific areas and sorting through any overlapping circles. The markers were generated with the color representing the depth of the natural disaster, while radius is correlated with size (magnitude) of the event.

While the code is original, the order of the elements was a collaboration with my classmate Kalisse Backer and AI.

# Limitations
- While we know earthquakes will generate aftershocks, it's important to note that the size of the bubbles don't represent the radius of those aftershocks.
